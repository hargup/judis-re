judis.nic.in is the government website that distributes supreme court and high
court judgments. However, recently the website changed significantly in terms
of how to download documents. Earlier it used a stable and structured URL for
all their judgments. Now these URLs do not work and it has become all state
based. Judgments can only be obtained by searching which gives you a state
variable. This variable combined with the result number gives you the actual
judgment.

These scripts use the date search form for downloading judgments.

You will need python for these scripts. And they are tested only on Gnu/Linux.
